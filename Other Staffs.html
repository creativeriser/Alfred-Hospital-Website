<span class="homepara2">Nurses--- Nurses play vital roles in patient care; without them, hospitals simply would not work.Our Nurses arguably spend the most time with patients. They monitor and observe patients around the clock.<br><br>
     Technicians---Radiology technicians, pharmacy technicians, surgical technicians, electroencephalogram technicians, patient care technicians …... (the list is long )are available.<br><br>
     Janitorial staff---These individuals have one of the most important jobs in the hospital: They help with hospital-wide infection control. They help prevent people from getting more sick.<br><br>
     Clerical staff ---This includes the clerks who serve as receptionists for the hospital units. <br><br>
     Food services staff ---There are all the people who cook hospital meals, transport and deliver the meals to each patient, and wash the leftover dishes.<br><br>
     Pharmacy staff--- We don’t know how many thousands of medications are available, but the pharmacy takes care of all of them.<br><br>
